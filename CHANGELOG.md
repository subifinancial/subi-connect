  Thanks [@keeganpotgieter](https://github.com/keeganpotgieter)! - # Changeset:
  Minor Update for Payroll Integration

  ## Overview

  This changeset introduces improvements to the handling of manual payroll
  connections and enhances the display of payroll integration options. The main
  goal is to provide flexibility in how connection types are presented to users,
  ensuring consistency across the application.

  ## Key Changes

  1. **Enum Update**: The payroll connection type for manual systems has been
     changed from `MANUAL` to `MANUALLY`. This change improves clarity by
     aligning the naming convention with the action (connecting manually).
  2. **New Prop for Visibility Control**:
     - Added a new optional prop, `showManualConnectionTypes`, to the
       `PayrollIntegrationListGrid` component. This prop allows developers to
       control the visibility of manual payroll connection types based on the
       application's context.
  3. **Conditional Rendering of Manual Connections**:
     - In the `PayrollIntegrationListGrid` component, added logic to
       conditionally render payroll systems based on the new
       `showManualConnectionTypes` prop. If set to `false`, manual payroll
       systems will not be displayed, enhancing user experience by reducing
       clutter in the UI.
  4. **Refactoring of Manual Connect Card**:
     - Updated the `ManualConnectCard` component to use the new `Payroll` enum
       for the name display, ensuring consistent references throughout the
       application.

  ## Detailed Changes

  ### 1. Update to `PayrollConnectionTypeEnum`

  **File**: `src/services/api/payroll/types.ts`

  ```diff
   export enum PayrollConnectionTypeEnum {
  -  MANUAL = 'MANUAL',
  +  MANUALLY = 'MANUALLY',
     CUSTOM = 'CUSTOM',
     OAUTH2 = 'OAUTH2',
     OAUTH2_AND_COMPANY_MANUALLY = 'OAUTH2_AND_COMPANY_MANUALLY',
  ```

## 4.0.3

### Patch Changes

- [#170](https://github.com/subifinancial/subi-connect/pull/170)
  [`57b9156`](https://github.com/subifinancial/subi-connect/commit/57b9156784f2699457cdf5fe58ad7da11885a8d5)
  Thanks [@keeganpotgieter](https://github.com/keeganpotgieter)! - This change
  updates the `SubiConnectProvider` and `useSubiConnectQuery` components to
  improve dependency management and query execution control. The changes address
  potential issues with stale closures and ensure that queries are only executed
  when the SubiConnect context is properly initialised.

  - **Query Execution Control**: The `useSubiConnectQuery` hook now checks the
    `initialised` state of the SubiConnect context before executing a query.
    This ensures that queries are not executed prematurely.

- [#171](https://github.com/subifinancial/subi-connect/pull/171)
  [`a322ebb`](https://github.com/subifinancial/subi-connect/commit/a322ebbd3d56b6c932c930aeb48e2ab64d8b6d62)
  Thanks [@keeganpotgieter](https://github.com/keeganpotgieter)! - Added a
  `updateAccessToken` method in `connection-service.ts` to update the access
  token in storage, and set the Authorization header with the new token—the
  error interceptor now uses this method to update the token.

## 4.0.2

### Patch Changes

- [#168](https://github.com/subifinancial/subi-connect/pull/168)
  [`d9496b6`](https://github.com/subifinancial/subi-connect/commit/d9496b6f9ca0eafe6960528329665b8f6bc0ec5e)
  Thanks [@keeganpotgieter](https://github.com/keeganpotgieter)! - This update
  refactors the logger implementation and improves dependency injection
  throughout the codebase. It introduces a new `Logger` class that can be
  instantiated and passed to other services, enhancing testability and
  flexibility.

  The changes address potential issues with global state and improve the overall
  architecture by:

  1. Replacing the global logger instance with a class-based approach
  2. Implementing dependency injection for the logger in various services
  3. Enhancing error handling in the connection service
  4. Improving the structure of interceptors by passing necessary dependencies

## 4.0.1

### Patch Changes

- [#165](https://github.com/subifinancial/subi-connect/pull/165)
  [`d77786f`](https://github.com/subifinancial/subi-connect/commit/d77786f70221e5263353c8432d7b959d06bd094c)
  Thanks [@keeganpotgieter](https://github.com/keeganpotgieter)! - ## Changes

  - Modified the `EmployeesTable` component to return `undefined` when the
    `contexts` array is empty, instead of returning an empty array. This ensures
    that when no columns are added, an empty context array isn't provided, so
    rows show correctly.

## 3.1.1

### Patch Changes

- [#160](https://github.com/subifinancial/subi-connect/pull/160)
  [`11ec1a5`](https://github.com/subifinancial/subi-connect/commit/11ec1a5a479d9800da94336f995e05d50ed6dc3a)
  Thanks [@keeganpotgieter](https://github.com/keeganpotgieter)! - ## Purpose

  This PR refactors the OAuth2 authentication flow and improves the handling of
  authentication windows. It introduces a new utility function for generating
  auth window options and updates the connect and integrate component to use
  this new approach.

  ## Problem Solved

  The changes aim to enhance the reliability and consistency of the OAuth2
  authentication process, particularly in handling authentication windows across
  different scenarios. It also improves code reusability by extracting common
  logic into a separate utility function.

  Thanks [@keeganpotgieter](https://github.com/keeganpotgieter)! - # Breaking
  Changes

  - The `SubiConnectProvider` now requires a `companyContext` prop, which is a
    string that uniquely identifies the organization (e.g., company ID or name).
  - Removed the `context` option from `SubiConnectOptions`.

  # New Features

  - Added type safety for the `companyContext` prop in `SubiConnectProvider`.

  # Improvements

  - Updated the `ACCESS_TOKEN_NAME` constant to use a shorter name: 'sc-cat'.
  - Enhanced the `ConnectionService` to handle context changes and update stored
    access tokens accordingly.
  - Improved type definitions for the connection function and related types.

  # Internal Changes

  - Updated demos, stories, and examples to use the new `companyContext` prop.
  - Refactored `ConnectionService` to use the new `companyContext` approach.
  - Updated `getAccessToken` function to use the new `SubiConnectConnectionFn`
    type.

  # Documentation

  - Added comments to `SubiConnectContext` and `SubiConnectProviderProps` for
    better documentation.

  This major version change requires users to update their `SubiConnectProvider`
  usage by adding the `companyContext` prop and removing any `context` option
  from `SubiConnectOptions`.

  [`c889971`](https://github.com/subifinancial/subi-connect/commit/c8899714450b8a5f8a94ea767428fb1188dd7fc6)
  Thanks [@keeganpotgieter](https://github.com/keeganpotgieter)! - Migrate build
  system from `rollup` to `tsup`

  We've transitioned our build process from `rollup` to `tsup` for the following
  reasons:

  1. Reduced bundle size: `tsup` produces smaller output files, optimizing our
     package for faster downloads and reduced storage requirements.
  2. Improved build performance: `tsup` significantly speeds up our build times,
     enhancing developer productivity and CI/CD efficiency.
  3. Simplified configuration: `tsup` offers a more streamlined setup with
     sensible defaults, reducing the complexity of our build configuration.
  4. Better TypeScript support: As a TypeScript-first bundler, `tsup` provides
     improved handling of TypeScript projects without additional plugins.
  5. Tree-shaking and code splitting: `tsup` includes built-in optimizations for
     tree-shaking and code splitting, further reducing bundle sizes and
     improving performance.

  This change should be transparent to end-users but will greatly benefit our
  development process and package distribution.

  ## Other Changes

  - Updated `SubiConnectOptions` to expose a `context` variable to differentiate
    contexts. See [Example 1](#example-1).
  - Updated `SubiConnectContext` to expose a `cleanup` function that can be used
    cleanup the Subi Connect Context when changing contexts, for example,
    logging out. See [Example 2](#example-2).
  - Moves styles import to `@subifinancial/subi-connect/styles.css`. See
    [Example 3](#example-3).

  ## Examples

  ### Example 1

          context: myCompany.name
      } satisfies SubiConnectOptions;

      return (
          <SubiConnectProvider connectionFn={connectionFn} options={options}>
              ...
          </SubiConnectProvider>
      );
